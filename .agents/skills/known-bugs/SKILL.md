Classification per the Context Engineering protocol: `CONFIRMED` / `FIXED` / `NOT REPRODUCED` / `UNKNOWN`.
All entries below are dated to the Sept 14–16 2026 live working session unless noted. **When you
fix or reproduce any of these, move them to the correct status and note the date — don't leave
this file stale.**

## FIXED (verified via clean compile / clean boot / live scan during the Sept session)

| # | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hardcoded JWT signing secret in `config.py` | Default removed; app fails fast without a real ≥32-char secret. Rotated locally and on Render. |
| 2 | 7 frontend pages bypassed shared `authenticatedFetch()`, sessions hard-failed every 15 min | Migrated all 7 to the shared helper. |
| 3 | Sidebar nav fell back to a scan-job ID when no brand ID was cached, sending users to the wrong brand's data | Fallback removed; links disable with a tooltip until a real brand ID exists. |
| 4 | Fabricated static "94.2% accuracy" shown before any hallucination audit ran | Replaced with an honest "Pending Audit" state. |
| 5 | Fabricated static "Sentiment: Neutral / RISING" badge, always shown regardless of real data | Replaced with "Pending Audit" (⚠️ not yet wired to real live sentiment data — see roadmap P2). |
| 6 | `Math.random()` used to fabricate missing weekly trend points on the score chart | Removed; only real historical points are plotted now. |
| 7 | Two hardcoded static metric bars ("Social Mention Share: 42%", "Technical Accuracy: 89%") with no backing data source anywhere in the backend | Removed entirely rather than left as fake numbers. |
| 8 | History page showed a fake "+14.2%" growth figure and fake "89.4" score when a brand had no history | Both replaced with a neutral "—". |
| 9 | `discovery/generator.py` used `random.uniform()` to fabricate "estimated lift %" / "competitor visibility %" shown to paying customers as if measured; related hardcoded `15.0` fallback found in `opportunities.py` during the same fix | Replaced with an honest qualitative tier (High/Medium, explicitly labeled "Preliminary Estimate") and null placeholders. |
| 10 | Benchmark corpus "General" fallback industry persisted `brand_count: 1` instead of `0`, suppressing the frontend's own "limited sample size" disclaimer | Fixed to persist `0`. |
| 11 | Total scan failure across all 3 providers, silently surfaced as "0 of 0" instead of a visible error (deprecated Groq model, retired Gemini model, exhausted OpenAI billing, all at once) | Groq/Gemini model IDs updated to verified-live models; OpenAI cleanly excluded from rotation (not deleted) pending billing top-up. Verified end-to-end: Zepto scan, 74/100, 36 real AI responses, $0.0082. |
| 2 | Placeholder "Your Brand" could leak into real API calls | Backend now returns brand_name in the scan-status response (hoisted safely, defaults to None on any failure). Frontend regex-guesser deleted entirely; falls back to an honest "Unknown Brand" label if brand_name is ever missing. Verified live on September 25 2026. |

## CONFIRMED — not yet fixed

| # | Bug | File(s) | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Revenue Intelligence crashes on **every** completed scan | `app/revenue/intelligence.py` | Variable defined as `revenue_per_point`, referenced as `revenue_per_visibility_point` a few lines later → `NameError`, observed live in production logs on every scan's post-processing step. **Fix: rename to match.** |
| 3 | Scan-start endpoint is fully synchronous, timeout risk | `app/api/scan.py` | Awaits 40+ concurrent LLM calls before responding; a real scan took several minutes. **Fix: return `202 Accepted` + `scan_job_id` immediately, run in a background task, poll/SSE for status.**<br><br>STATUS: Code changes deployed to production on September 26 2026 (backend commit 2c07e3f, frontend commit 169d43d) but NOT yet verified live end-to-end. Do not assume this works until a real scan has been watched through to completion in production. |
| 4 | Fake scan-progress animation | `components/ScanningProgress.tsx` | Fixed hardcoded-timer steps ("Querying ChatGPT (OpenAI)…", "Indexing Claude (Anthropic)…") referencing providers not actually called (OpenAI excluded, Claude never integrated); observed showing "COMPLETED" on all steps while the real backend scan was still running minutes later. **Fix: poll `completed_prompts`/`total_prompts` from the real scan-status endpoint; only reference actually-active providers.**<br><br>STATUS: Code changes deployed to production on September 26 2026 (backend commit 2c07e3f, frontend commit 169d43d) but NOT yet verified live end-to-end. Do not assume this works until a real scan has been watched through to completion in production. |
| 5 | ~35 ESLint warnings (unescaped JSX quotes) + a React 19 set-state-in-effect violation causing cascading re-renders | `OverviewTab.tsx`, `ActionPlanTab.tsx`, `workspaces/page.tsx`, `SidebarLayout.tsx` | Low priority — no runtime correctness impact, lint cleanliness only. |

## UNKNOWN

| # | Item | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `schema.sql` table count | Two audit passes reported 23 vs 18 in the same session. Never resolved — count `CREATE TABLE` statements directly before trusting either number. |
| 2 | Hallucination two-tier verification behavior when OpenAI is excluded | Not confirmed whether the OpenAI cross-verification step no-ops cleanly or errors when the provider is disabled. |
